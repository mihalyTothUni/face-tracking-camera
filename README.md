# Face tracking camera mount

Little project im working on instead of preparing for my finals

It uses a webcam and the server python script to detect a face (or anything you can find a Haar cascade for)

Sends the coordinates of the face within the image over serial to a raspberry pi pico that moves the camera platform accordingly

Currently only panning is implemented correctly, waiting for 3d printer to finish the platform for vertical tracking
